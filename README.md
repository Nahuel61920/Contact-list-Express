# Contact list 

### Contact list created with NodeJs and ExpressJs
<hr>
It is a list of contacts that extracts information from an internal database that contains an array of objects with the properties name, surname, number, gmail and thanks to NodeJs we can export our database to be able to use it on our server, which is integrated in Express and we can return our contacts, as well as through ID we can search, edit and delete them from our database
